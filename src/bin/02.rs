/// # [Problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2): Even Fibonnaci Numbers
///
/// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first terms will be:
///
/// 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...
///
/// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
